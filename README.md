## Contents
- Exploratory analysis of national demand from 2009 to 2024 with resampling and rolling statistics
- Clean plots with Matplotlib and interactive visuals with Plotly
- Simple error metric calculation for sanity checks on trends
- Clear, readable code that can be discussed during a technical interview


## Notebook outline
- Load libraries and configuration
- Load demand and generation data, parse, clean and join them.
- Resample to investigate energy demand trends at different time scale
- Compute rolling means and baseline forecast for the future 48h window
- Train `GradientBoostRegression` models with different features
- Compare forecasting ML models with the baseline 
- Assess feature importance for the ML models
- Short conclusions and discussion points


## Data
Primary external sources:
Demand data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albertovidalrod/electricity-consumption-uk-20092022/data) retrived using `kagglehub`
Generation data from [NESO Energy API](https://www.neso.energy/data-portal/historic-generation-mix/historic_gb_generation_mix#) retrieved using `requests`

Once retrieved the datasets are saved to /data as .csv files.
